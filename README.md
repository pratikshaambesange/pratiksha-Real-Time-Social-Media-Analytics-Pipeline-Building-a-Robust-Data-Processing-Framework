# Real-Time-Social-Media-Analytics-Pipeline-Building-a-Robust-Data-Processing-Framework

### 📌 Overview
This project aims to build a **real-time social media analytics pipeline** to extract meaningful insights from various platforms. It includes **sentiment analysis, hashtag clustering, and engagement prediction** using machine learning models.

The system processes high-velocity data, enabling businesses and researchers to monitor trends and user engagement efficiently.

### 🚀 Tech Stack Used
🐍 **Python** – for data processing and model training  
📊 **Google Colab** – for dataset analysis and model development  
🌐 **Flask** – for web framework and deployment  
🤖 **Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow** – for machine learning models  
📈 **Pandas, NumPy** – for data manipulation  
📉 **Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly** – for data visualization  
💾 **Joblib** – for model saving/loading  

### 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes various features such as:
✔ Social media text content  
✔ Hashtags and keywords  
✔ Likes, shares, and comments  
✔ User engagement metrics  
✔ Sentiment scores  

### 🛠 Preprocessing Steps:
✅ Handling missing values  
✅ Encoding categorical variables  
✅ Normalizing numerical features  
✅ Removing stopwords and special characters from text  

### 🔥 Model Training Process
#### 📌 Data Preprocessing:
✅ Tokenization and text cleaning  
✅ Feature scaling for numerical data  

#### 🏆 Model Selection & Training:
✅ **Sentiment Analysis** using VADER  
✅ **Hashtag Clustering** using TF-IDF and K-Means  
✅ **Engagement Prediction** using Random Forest  
✅ Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  

#### 📊 Model Evaluation:
✅ **Silhouette Score** for clustering  
✅ **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** for regression models  
✅ **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**  
✅ **F1 Score, Accuracy** for classification tasks  

#### 📈 Visualization Techniques:
✅ Word Clouds for trending topics  
✅ Correlation heatmaps  
✅ Cluster distribution plots  
✅ Model performance graphs  

### 🌍 Model Deployment using Flask/Django
1️⃣ User inputs text/hashtags via a web form  
2️⃣ Pre-trained models analyze data in real-time  
3️⃣ Results are displayed on the dashboard
